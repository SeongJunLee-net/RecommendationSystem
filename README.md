# RecommendationSystem

This is the repository for your capstone project in 2024. My team decided to develop a matching service, and I decided to develop a recommendation system for it. However, due to the lack of data, I decided to try clustering and studied several clustering algorithms.
(I wrote about this in my Notion).

ðŸ’¡ In the future, I would like to utilize Softmax Function for unsupervised classification.

ðŸ’¡ Additionally, some of the Jupyter notebooks in the repository are available in the 

[Personalized Recommendation System with Python, by Lim Il].

Of course, I also summarized the basic recommendation system knowledge in the book, so I hope you enjoy it!
